Author: Sidharth Mishra

This is a work in progress. More updates soon.


## Latest updates on the [`without-ownerships` branch](https://github.com/sidmishraw/mustash-stm-v2/tree/without-ownerships)


## Requirements

* Java 8+

* Gradle - wrapper included with the source

* Eclipse/IntelliJ Idea + Project Lombok - used for boilerplate reduction



## Changelog

* Added `commitLock` and `stmLock` locks in the STM.
